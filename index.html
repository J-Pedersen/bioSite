        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>
          Being a published Author is one of Terri"s biggest goals in life and 
          she has some great ideas of what to write about but she just needs 
          the time and motivation to make that happen so this is a goal I fully 
          expect her to reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Terri has been passionate about writing since she was a young girl, 
          and has always had a natural talent for storytelling. 
          Terri envisions herself as a published author, sharing her stories with 
          the world and inspiring others to follow their dreams. She is determined 
          to make this a reality, and is excited to see where her writing journey 
          will take her.

        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>
          Visting <a href="https://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-travel-guide/geography-and-environment.html" target="_blank" title="Tibetian Tourism">Tibet</a> is high on Terri's bucketlist. She hopes to be able to 
          travel there and visit some of the buddist monastaries and just soak 
          in some of the beauty and tranquillity of being in the mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Terri has always been fascinated by the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buddhism" target="_blank" title="Buddhism Explained">teachings of Buddhism</a> and would 
          love to learn more about the religion while in Tibet. She believes that 
          immersing herself in the culture and daily practices of the monks would 
          be a life-changing experience. Additionally, she is excited to explore 
          the breathtaking landscapes and scenery that Tibet has to offer.

        <p>
          Terri would like to eventually go back to college for her masters degree or 
          perhaps even a doctorate. She also has considered becoming a professor and 
          teaching psychology and or substance abuse counseling to others. Perhaps 
          even starting her own clinic.
