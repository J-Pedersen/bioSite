        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>Being a published Author is one of Terri"s biggest goals in life and 
            she has some great ideas of what to write about but she just needs 
            the time and motivation to make that happen so this is a goal I fully 
            expect her to reach.</p>

        <h3 class="agn-lt">Travel</h3>
        <p class="agn-lt">Visting Tibet is high on Terri's bucketlist. She hopes to be able to 
            travel there and visit some of the buddist monastaries and just soak 
            in some of the beauty and tranquillity of being in the mountains.</p>

        <h3>Academia</h3>
        <p>Terri would like to eventually go back to college for her masters degree or 
            perhaps even a doctorate. She also has considered becoming a professor and 
            teaching psychology and or substance abuse counseling to others. Perhaps 
            even starting her own clinic.</p>
