        <h3>Games</h3>
        <p>Terri loves to play games on her phone. She enjoys the challenge of solving puzzles
             and finding hidden words, and the satisfaction she feels when she finally succeeds.
             One ofthe things she loves most about these games is that they exercise her brain 
             and keep her mind sharp.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally Terri finds that playing her games is a good way for her to decompress
            and unwind after her long and stressful day. Puzzles and word games are amoung her 
            favorites but solitaire is a game that she also plays quite often.

        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>Reading is a pass time Terri enjoys but doesn't do as much as she used to because
            other things seem more important at the time or life gets in the way. From a young age, 
            she was drawn to books and reading about all the wonderous worlds created by her favorite 
            writers.

            non-fiction as well.
